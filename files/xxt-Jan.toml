abstract = "Cross-cultural research in social and behavioral sciences has expanded hugely over the past 50 years, but progress is currently hampered by a lack of appreciation of the profoundly differing principles and goals of two distinct traditions. The first is the main variant of cross-cultural psychology (CCP), focusing on how culture shapes individual psychological functioning. The second was pioneered by Hofstede. It studies societal differences, and we name it comparative culturology” (CC). We explain how these two paradigms differ. CCP is grounded in psychology and typically looks for unobservable  ndividual-level constructs, which supposedly exist independently of their measurement, to provide understanding of individual differences as affected by culture. CC is an interdisciplinary field whose roots and impact span sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, management studies, psychology, and beyond. CC measures cultural dimensions as group-level constructs created by researchers, which are best understood as ecological manifolds: conglomerates of conceptually and statistically associated variables (not necessarily held together by a single underlying factor) that collectively explain national (and other group) differences. Given these paradigmatic distinctions, the two fields need not, and cannot, use the same validation methods. They should co-exist and collaborate based on mutual appreciation of their differences, without attempts by either field to impose its idiosyncrasies on the other."

abstract = "We report on an experimental study that explores cross-cultural differences in perception of trustworthiness based on facial traits. In the first part of the experiment, individual male and female neutral photographs of Buryats (Mongolian people of Eastern Siberia) were rated on trustworthiness by men and women from the same population. The trustworthy-looking facial traits were investigated by means of geometric morphometrics, and analysis of the facial action units using artificial neural network (FaceReader). Significant associations between facial traits and perceived trustworthiness were revealed only for male photographs rated by men. Facial shape pattern along trustworthy–untrustworthy vector corresponded to the facial femininity-masculinity vector for Buryats, as well as to the positive-negative vector of the emotional connotation of the neutral facial shape. “Untrustworthy” facial shape was characterized by relatively narrower lower jaw, lower set eyebrows, as well as a lower position of the “Brow Lowerer” facial action unit—a frown. In the second part of the experiment, two geometric morphometric morphs, representing “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy” Buryat male facial shapes, were judged on trustworthiness by male representatives of Buryat, Tuvan (Mongolian people of Southern Siberia), Russian, Indian, and East African (Tanzanians) cultures. The results revealed that in all studied samples the “trustworthy” male portrait was rated significantly higher on trustworthiness than “untrustworthy” one. However, perceived trustworthiness, and agreement of portrait judgments with those of Buryats significantly declined with geographic and genetic distance between populations."

abstract = "However, whether the same principle applies to progress prediction errors remains unclear. We empirically and computationally evaluate the hypothesis that affect reflects the difference between expected and actual progress in forming a perceptual decision. We model affect within an evidence accumulation framework where actual progress is mapped onto the drift-rate parameter and expected progress onto an expected drift-rate parameter. Affect is computed as the difference between the expected and actual amount of accumulated evidence. We find that expected and actual progress both influence affect, but in an additive manner that does not align with a prediction error account. Our computational model reproduces both task behavior and affective ratings, suggesting that sequential sampling models provide a promising framework to model progress appraisals. These results show that although affect is sensitive to both expected and actual progress, it does not reflect the computation of a progress prediction error."
